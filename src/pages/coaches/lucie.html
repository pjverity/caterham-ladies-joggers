				<h5 class="mt-0">Lucie</h5>
				<p>I never enjoyed running! I liked competitive sports but I couldn’t understand the point of going for a run.</p>
				<p>When Anna started RLJ she asked me to join for support! I told her I’d rather poke pins in my eyes but I would give it a try as she was my friend.</p>
				<p>CONVERT! This was competitive. I could beat my own times and distance AND could have a chat at the same time.</p>
				<p>For me running turned into an oasis of my thoughts. I’ve always loved being outside and this meant I could clear my head, or pound the pavement if I needed to. It was THERAPY! And sometimes a shower rolled into one!</p>
				<p>I became a coach for Caterham Ladies Joggers in June 2017 and have absolutely loved meeting new people, helping ladies with their goals, sharing their achievements and pushing them when they have needed it.</p>
				<p>I also LOVE awkward pictures so you can trust me to take them when your running up the hill</p>
