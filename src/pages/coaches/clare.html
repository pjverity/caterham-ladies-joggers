				<p>Hi, my name is Clare. I have always enjoyed exercise and mainly played team sports.</p>
				<p>After my third child I found it a bit more tricky to get back into  shape and to lose weight. I was still playing netball weekly, but wanted to do something else to help get my fitness levels back up. So I joined Reigate Ladies Joggers on a beginner course. And 5 years later I am now a run leader, coaching ladies for Caterham Ladies Joggers.</p>
				<p>My day job is a teacher, I work at a busy prep school in Oxted teaching PE, swimming, games and Maths. When not at work, playing netball or running I have 3 lovely children to keep me busy!!!</p>
