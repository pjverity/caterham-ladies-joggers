				<h5 class="mt-0">Denise</h5>
				<p>I’ve always enjoyed sports, either running after a hockey ball or a tennis  ball and I daily run for my trains just to get in the miles.</p>
				<p>I grew up in Zimbabwe where playing sport was a privilege throughout the year whatever the weather and I must admit I do struggle with going out on the cold damp dark winter nights but joining CLJ motivated me to run.</p>
				<p>I started running with CLJ over a year ago and it’s made me concentrate on my 10kms and building my stamina.  Making this healthy choice has helped me get fitter, gain more stamina and become faster as I’ve always had a competitive streak in me. I’m now a coach for CLJ and really enjoy meeting like minded ladies like me and watching them progress in their running is inspiring.</p>
				<p>My busy lifestyle and working in the heart of London makes it challenging to find the time to exercise. I found that CLJ  gave the flexibility as well as had different groups depending on my ability.</p>
				<p>I believe in a work life balance and to achieve success in work I believe you have to be fit, energetic and active to get the best out of your day and running is a perfect way to achieve that!</p>
				<p>Regards,Den</p>
