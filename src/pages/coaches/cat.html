				<p>I remember my first ever run in my early 20’s. A couple of friends and I signed up for Run for Life and we’d wheeze our way around Tooting Common. I’ve not looked back since, it didn’t just give me the running bug but helped forge some of my closest friendships with my running buddies - there is nothing as bonding as a run on a beautiful day nor a run through the pelting rain and harsh wind. As I work from home and have two young children, running gives me the headspace to think and to breathe and enjoy the day for what it is. It’s such an empowering way to build self confidence and battle your own enemies.</p>
				<p>CLJ has given me the chance to run with some amazing ladies, helping them and challenging them every week to get the most out of their sessions and progress is such a great reward.</p>
				<p>Running with a group is not just a great way to train but a great way to make new friends and share experiences - therapy for mind and body.</p>
