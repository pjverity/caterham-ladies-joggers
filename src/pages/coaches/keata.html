				<p>Running has always been a huge part of my life. I grew up in South Africa where sports and running played a huge role. My parents used to drop me off at school early and
					we were made to see how many kilometres we could do before school and by the time I was 9, I was running around 200km a year.</p>
				<p>My husband and I both love running and he really inspires me to push myself further. I like to concentrate on 10kms or half marathons, when my husband prefers marathons
					and triathlons. We both have an infinity for spinning and we used to run a studio in London, exercise is just a huge passion for us.</p>
				<p>What I love about running is that it is there for everyone, you don’t have to be good at it, you don’t need to be picked for a team, you just need to put your running
					shoes on. My son is 7 and has just started running, I love going out with him and seeing that he can get the same enjoyment as me from running outside.</p>
				<p>When I am not running, I am busy running my freelance marketing company and looking after my 3 kids.</p>
