				<p>Hi, my name is Wendy and I haven’t always been a runner. Many years ago I did the Race for Life and then after that just continued to be a gym goer!<p>
				<p>In 2011 I signed up to do the Great South Run (10 miles) as my friend’s set up a charity to remember the son they’d lost and as a group of friends we all decided to do
					it. I figured I could at least run a mile, but after my first jog out I realised I needed to go back to basics and run a minute, walk a minute and build up. I was so
					pleased with the achievement of doing this run and after that I got the running bug as many people tend to do.</p>
				<p>I joined Caterham Ladies Joggers back in 2016 as a beginner, I didn’t really need to be a beginner, but a friend suggested I joined up as I wasn’t in a great place in my
					personal life. After that first course I was asked if I’d like to help out with the following course with a view to then taking my own group and I haven’t looked back
					since! I also completed the Royal Parks Half Marathon in 2017, something which I’m really proud of.</p>
				<p>I love meeting new people and helping them to achieve their running goals and as everyone will tell you running is not only great for your physical strength and stamina
					but it’s also really good for your mental health. It’s not always easy, especially in the winter months to go for a run on your own so this club ensures that you get out
					and do just that.</p>
